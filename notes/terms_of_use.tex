\section*{Cantr Terms of Use}

\thispagestyle{empty} 

As a member of the Cantr Programming Department (the ``ProgD'') I understand and agree to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Writealyze LLC (``Writealyze'') whose representative is Joshua Mathias, is the owner of the web-based game Cantr and its associated websites (``Cantr''), and all content in Cantr, including site layout, design, coding, programs, text and other information is the property of Writealyze and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.
\item The ProgD is a group of volunteers who assist with the ongoing upkeep of Cantr, including but not limited to such tasks as maintenance of or fixing errors in Cantr, creation of new elements to Cantr, and maintenance of the servers hosting Cantr.
\item As a member of the ProgD I will be granted access to coding and other elements of Cantr which are Writealyze's exclusive property. I will use said elements only for my role with the ProgD. Specifically, I will not utilize them to advance or aid any Cantr character played by me or anyone else, nor will I use said elements to create or enhance any other game or program outside of Cantr.
\item Any original programming or material input created by me for Cantr will become the property of Cantr and its Owner(s). Should I cease involvement in the ProgD for any reason, my original programming or material input shall remain the property of Writealyze and may be used by Joshua for Cantr as he chooses going forward.
\end{itemize}
